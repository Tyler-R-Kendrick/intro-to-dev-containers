# What Are Dev Containers?

## 1. Definition
Dev Containers are preconfigured development environments defined using containers. They package your project’s code, tools, runtimes, and settings into a single, version-controlled definition. By using a `devcontainer.json` file and Docker, you can ensure that every developer works in an identical setup regardless of their local operating system.

## 2. Solving "Works on My Machine"
Containers isolate the application and its dependencies from the host machine. This isolation guarantees that if code runs successfully inside the Dev Container, it will run the same way in other containers—whether on a coworker’s laptop, a CI server, or GitHub Codespaces. This eliminates the classic “it works on my machine” problem by standardizing the environment.

## 3. Key Technologies
- Docker: The container engine for building and running images.
- VS Code Remote - Containers Extension: Connects your local VS Code to the container for seamless editing, debugging, and terminals.
- devcontainer.json: A JSON schema that defines the container’s base image, installed extensions, forwarded ports, environment variables, mounts, and post-create commands.

## 4. Summary
Dev Containers streamline onboarding, reduce environment drift, and foster reproducible builds. By codifying your development environment once, you create a reliable workflow for local development, CI, and cloud-based IDEs—boosting team productivity and minimizing setup friction.
